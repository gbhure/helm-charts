# Deploy a single replica of Kafka during development
#
# Tested with v0.8.8 of the chart from the helm incubator
#
# ex:
#   helm install -f examples/kafka-single.yaml --version 0.8.8 -n cord-kafka incubator/kafka

# ref: https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#configuration
configurationOverrides:
  "offsets.topic.replication.factor": 1
  "log.retention.hours": 4
  "log.message.timestamp.type": "LogAppendTime"

# NOTE: The log.message.timestamp.type override causes timestamps set by the
# producer be overridden on the broker. This should be removed once all kafka
# libraries have been updated to use the newer v1 message format that add the
# timestamp to the message.
#
# The `afkak` client in VOLTHA uses the outdated format, and reports -1 as the
# timestamp.
